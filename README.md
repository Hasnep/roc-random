# (Pseudo-)Randomness for Roc

A [Roc](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc) ðŸ¦… library for ðŸŽ² number generation (and more!)

This library aims to provide the Roc ecosystem with all of the
general-purpose pure functions that app/package developers need
to manipulate raw randomness into useful inputs for anything -
from fuzz tests to simulations to video games.
With no side effects (like reading from a clock or sensor),
this library processes your own noise sample(s) ("seed(s)")
into your desired shapes, distributions, and sequences.

If you're an app developer who's unsure how to get a varying seed,
see what you can sense using the effects provided by your chosen Roc platform.
`Time.now!`? `Mouse.coordinates!`? `CPU.temperature!`? `Your.choice!`

Contributions & feedback are very welcome!

## Examples

See the `examples/*.roc` files for various complete examples, but here is a minimal preview:

### Print a list of 10 random numbers in the range 25-75 inclusive

```roc
# Create a generator for numbers between 25-75 (inclusive).
generate_a_number = Random.bounded_u32(25, 75)

# Create a generator for lists of 10 numbers.
generate_ten_numbers = generate_a_number |> Random.list(10)

# Initialise "randomness". (Bring Your Own source of noise.)
Random.seed 1234
|> Random.step(generate_ten_numbers)
|> .value
|> Inspect.to_str
|> Stdout.line!
```

## Documentation

See [the library documentation site](https://jancvanb.github.io/roc-random/0.5.0/Random/)
for more info about its API.

## Goals

- An external API that is similar to that of
  [Elm's `Random` library](https://github.com/elm/random)
- An internal implementation that is similar to that of
  [Rust's `Rand` library](https://github.com/rust-random/rand)
- Compatible with every Roc platform
  (though some platforms may provide poor/constant [seeding](#seeding))
- Provides a variety of ergonomic abstractions

## Seeding

In order to receive a different sequence of outputs from this library between executions of your application, your Roc platform of choice must provide a random/pseudorandom/varying seed.

Otherwise, your pure functions will be responsible for providing `Random`'s pure functions with a constant seed that will merely choose which predictable sequence you'll receive.

## TODO

- Support common non-uniform distributions (Gaussian, etc.)
